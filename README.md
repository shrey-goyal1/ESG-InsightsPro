# ESG Insights Pro

## Overview

**ESG Insights Pro** is a comprehensive data science and visualization project focused on forecasting and analyzing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) emissions data. This project includes a powerful deep learning model implemented in Python, a detailed dataset of ESG emissions, and an interactive Power BI dashboard for insightful visualizations. It is designed to assist policymakers, analysts, and researchers in tracking emission trends and making informed decisions.

## Features

- **Forecasting Model**: Uses the N-BEATS deep learning model to predict ESG emissions based on historical trends.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and R² Score for performance evaluation.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Power BI dashboard to explore forecasts and ESG trends across countries, sectors, and substances.
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Includes normalization, trend alignment, and variability adjustments to improve forecast accuracy.
- **Multi-Year Forecasting**: Supports long-term forecasting from 2023 to 2042 using refined model techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend/Visualization**: Power BI
- **Backend/Modeling**: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Data Handling**: Excel (`Dataset.xlsx`)
- **Notebook Interface**: Jupyter Notebook (`ESG-InsightsPro.ipynb`)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or above
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Power BI Desktop
- Required Python Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `torch`
  - `scikit-learn`

## Setup

### Setup Dataset and Notebook

1. Open `ESG-InsightsPro.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Ensure all required Python libraries are installed.
3. Load the `Dataset.xlsx` file from the same directory.
4. Run all cells in the notebook to execute the forecasting pipeline.

### Setup Power BI Dashboard

1. Open `Dashboard.pbix` using Power BI Desktop.
2. Ensure the dataset paths and sources are correctly linked if prompted.
3. Explore the dashboard for visual analysis of ESG trends and predictions.

## Usage

- **Forecasting**: Use the notebook to generate predictions based on historical data.
- **Evaluation**: Analyze the model’s accuracy with built-in metrics and plots.
- **Visualization**: View and present insights through the interactive Power BI dashboard.
